This will be the first iration of my Portfolio. It will show everyone some of the bigger projects that I have done and also about me.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

So in this challenge I used HTML and CSS code to build my first website and page! So first I wrote my HTML and made all of my boxes and all the essential things that make up a webpage and make it functional. Then I started on my CSS sheet. And that's where I made my page look nice and give the page life. There were times where I had to restart and move around the boxes so they would work in the space. But it all came out nice in the end. I hope you enjoy my webpage!
